Implementation of  Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) using the closed form equations from scratch.
Assumption 1 :
Both the classes have the same co-variance matrix i.e. Σ0 = Σ1 = Σ. Report the
values of the means, µ0 and µ1, and the co-variance matrix Σ.
Assumption 2:
Both classes have different covariance matrix.
